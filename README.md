# Data-Scraping
The GoFundMe Campaign Scraper is a Python tool for collecting data on Gaza-related GoFundMe campaigns. Using Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and pandas, it scrapes campaign details like titles, organizers, amounts raised, and descriptions. It saves progress to resume if interrupted and exports the data to a CSV file for analysis.
